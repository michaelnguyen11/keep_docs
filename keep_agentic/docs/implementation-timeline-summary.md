| **2: LLM Fine-tuning & Base Agent** | 2 months | Model fine-tuning and orchestration | - Fine-tuned base model<br>- Orchestrator agent<br>- Memory store |
| **3: Full Agent Ecosystem** | 2 months | Specialized agent development | - Incident analysis agent<br>- Root cause analysis agent<br>- Remediation suggestion agent |
| **4: Human Feedback & UI** | 2 months | User interface and feedback | - Feedback system<br>- Agent insights visualization<br>- User acceptance testing |
| **5: Deployment & Improvement** | 2 months | Production deployment | - Staged deployment<br>- Performance optimization<br>- User training |

## Key Milestones

1. **Month 1**: Complete architecture and planning
2. **Month 3**: Keep platform integrated with monitoring systems
3. **Month 5**: First fine-tuned model and orchestrator agent
4. **Month 7**: Complete specialized agent ecosystem
5. **Month 9**: Full UI and feedback system
6. **Month 11**: Production system with measurable benefits

## Resource Requirements

### Hardware
- Development workstations with GPUs
- GPU-enabled server for model fine-tuning
- Kubernetes cluster for production deployment

### Software & Services
- DeepSeek R1 (or similar) base models for fine-tuning
- LangGraph framework for agent development
- Vector database for knowledge storage

## Expected Benefits

- **Data Processing**: 98% reduction in data requiring human attention
- **OPEX Reduction**: 40% decrease in level 1 support requirements
- **MTTR Improvement**: 65% reduction in mean time to resolution
- **Incident Prevention**: 25% of potential incidents proactively remediated
- **ROI**: Expected return on investment within 9 months of deployment

## Next Steps

1. Approve resource allocation for Phase 0
2. Designate team members and responsibilities
3. Schedule kickoff meeting
4. Begin system analysis and environment setup
