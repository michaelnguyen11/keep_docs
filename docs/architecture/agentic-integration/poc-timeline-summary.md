# Agentic AI Integration: PoC Timeline Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the 4-week Proof of Concept timeline for demonstrating the integration of Agentic AI capabilities with the Keep AIOps platform.

## PoC Overview

- **Team**: 3 members (1 AI Expert, 2 Junior AI Engineers)
- **Duration**: 4 weeks (20 business days)
- **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Keep with Agentic AI for high-volume log processing

## Key Activities and Deliverables

| Week | Focus | Key Activities | Deliverables |
|------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **1** | Setup & Architecture | - Environment setup<br>- Keep platform installation<br>- Sample data preparation | - Working development environment<br>- PoC architecture diagram<br>- Test datasets |

| **3** | Agent Development | - Orchestrator agent<br>- Specialized agent<br>- Agent communication | - Agent prototypes<br>- Optimized prompts<br>- Inter-agent communication |
| **4** | UI & Demonstration | - Basic UI integration<br>- End-to-end testing<br>- Demo preparation | - Working demonstration<br>- Technical documentation<br>- Proposed roadmap |

## PoC Scope

To ensure the PoC can be completed within 4 weeks, we will:

- Process a subset of logs (~10GB) rather than the full 600GB/day
- Use existing LLMs without custom fine-tuning
- Implement one specialized agent instead of the full ecosystem
- Connect to only one monitoring system
- Create a simplified UI for demonstration purposes

## Success Criteria

1. Keep can be integrated with Agentic AI components
2. ML filtering can reduce log volume by at least 90%
3. Orchestrator can direct work to a specialized agent
4. Agent provides useful insights beyond raw log data

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Environment**:
  - 3 workstations with GPUs for development
  - Cloud-based LLM inference capabilities
  - Development instance of Keep platform

- **Software & Services**:
  - Access to OpenAI API or Anthropic API
  - LangGraph for agent orchestration
  - Basic monitoring system access

## Next Steps

If the PoC is successful:

1. Gather stakeholder feedback
2. Refine architecture based on learnings
3. Develop detailed implementation plan for production
4. Secure resources for full implementation
5. Prioritize components for production phase 1
