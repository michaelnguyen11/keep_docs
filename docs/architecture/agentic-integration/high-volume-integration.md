# High-Volume Log Processing with Agentic AI Integration

This document outlines the architectural approach for integrating Agentic AI capabilities with the Keep AIOps platform for environments with extremely high log volumes (600GB+ per day).

## Overview

The Keep AIOps platform serves as a centralized monitoring solution, integrating with multiple enterprise monitoring tools such as Dynatrace, SolarWinds, OpenSearch, Splunk, and Grafana. The proposed architecture leverages Keep's existing ML capabilities for initial log filtering before passing relevant data to a multi-agent AI system for deeper analysis.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Leverage existing processing**: Utilize Keep's ML and rules engines for initial filtering
2. **Tiered processing**: Process data in tiers of increasing complexity and cost
3. **Relevant context only**: Only pass filtered and relevant data to AI agents
4. **Specialized analysis**: Use domain-specific agents for deeper system understanding
5. **Human feedback loop**: Incorporate operator feedback to improve agent performance

## Key Components

### Keep AIOps Platform Components

1. **Provider System**: Integrates with external monitoring systems
   - Handles data ingestion from all monitoring sources (600GB+ logs/day)
   - Normalizes data formats from different sources
   - Supports various protocols and APIs

2. **ML Engine**: Applies machine learning for initial filtering
   - Performs anomaly detection
   - Identifies patterns and correlations
   - Reduces data volume by filtering normal system behavior

3. **Rules Engine**: Applies user-defined rules for alert correlation
   - Implements business-specific filtering logic
   - Correlates related alerts based on defined criteria
   - Creates incidents based on rule matches

4. **Incident Management**: Manages the lifecycle of incidents
   - Tracks incident status and resolution
   - Assigns ownership and priority
   - Maintains incident history

5. **Workflow Engine**: Executes automated responses
   - Runs predefined response playbooks
   - Integrates with external systems for actions
   - Tracks workflow execution status

### Agentic AI System Components

1. **Log Preprocessing Pipeline**: Prepares data for agent consumption
   - Summarizes log content
   - Extracts key metrics and patterns
   - Creates indexed representations for efficient retrieval

2. **Context Assembler**: Assembles relevant context for analysis
   - Retrieves only data relevant to the current incident
   - Creates context packages with appropriate scope
   - Maintains historical context for comparison

3. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates specialized agent activities
   - Determines which specialized agents to engage
   - Validates and integrates results from specialized agents
   - Manages the overall analysis workflow

4. **Specialized Agents**: Perform domain-specific analysis
   - **Incident Analysis Agent**: Analyzes incident details
   - **Root Cause Analysis Agent**: Determines underlying causes
   - **Remediation Suggestion Agent**: Recommends resolution actions

5. **Agent Memory Store**: Maintains persistent knowledge
   - Stores previous observations and reasoning
   - Enables learning from past incidents
   - Provides context for current analysis

6. **Human Feedback System**: Collects operator feedback
   - Captures feedback on agent recommendations
   - Incorporates feedback into agent memory
   - Enables continuous improvement

## Data Flow

1. **Monitoring Systems → Keep**
   - All 600GB+ daily log volume enters the Keep platform
   - Data is normalized and timestamped

2. **Within Keep Platform**
   - ML Engine and Rules Engine filter the data
   - Only anomalous or rule-matching data continues
   - Filtered data volume is reduced by approximately 98%

3. **Keep → Agentic System**
   - Only relevant, filtered logs and alerts are forwarded
   - Data is packaged with contextual information
   - Preprocessing further summarizes and structures the data

4. **Within Agentic System**
   - Orchestrator agent directs specialized agents
   - Specialized agents perform focused analysis
   - Results are aggregated and validated by the orchestrator

5. **Agentic System → Keep**
   - Analysis results and recommendations are returned to Keep
   - Insights are incorporated into incident records
   - Recommended actions are integrated with the workflow engine

## Performance Considerations

To handle 600GB+ logs per day, the system implements:

1. **Streaming processing**: Near-real-time processing of logs without full storage
2. **Tiered storage**: High-performance storage for recent data, archival for historical
3. **Distributed processing**: Horizontal scaling of processing workloads
4. **Selective persistence**: Only storing relevant data for long-term analysis
5. **Batch summarization**: Creating periodic summaries of system state

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Enhance Keep's existing ML capabilities for improved filtering
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the preprocessing pipeline and context assembler
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy the orchestrator agent and first specialized agent
4. **Phase 4**: Add remaining specialized agents and memory system
5. **Phase 5**: Implement the human feedback loop and continuous improvement

## Benefits

This architecture provides several key benefits:

1. **Cost efficiency**: LLM processing only applied to relevant data
2. **Timely analysis**: Multi-tier processing ensures critical issues are prioritized
3. **Deep insights**: Specialized agents provide domain-specific expertise
4. **Continuous improvement**: System learns from its operations and human feedback
5. **Scalability**: Architecture can handle increasing log volumes

## Conclusion

By leveraging Keep's existing capabilities for initial filtering and implementing a tiered multi-agent system for deeper analysis, this architecture enables effective handling of extremely high log volumes while providing intelligent, contextual incident management and response recommendations.
