# Integrating Agentic Features into Keep AIOps Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural approach for integrating Agentic AI capabilities into the Keep AIOps platform. Rather than replacing Keep's existing workflow system, this integration adopts a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms:

- **Keep's Workflow System**: Provides deterministic, reliable, and auditable execution of operational tasks
- **Agentic AI (LangGraph)**: Brings flexibility, context-awareness, and intelligent decision-making capabilities

## Integration Strategy

The integration follows a hybrid approach that maintains Keep's core workflow engine while introducing Agentic features through LangGraph at strategic points in the architecture.

### Core Principles

1. **Augmentation, Not Replacement**: Agentic features enhance rather than replace the existing workflow system
2. **Progressive Autonomy**: Start with human-in-the-loop approval for agent actions, gradually increasing autonomy as confidence grows
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Establish explicit permissions and constraints for agent operations
4. **Full Observability**: Ensure all agent activities are logged, monitored, and explainable

## Use Cases

The integration will initially focus on these high-value use cases:

1. **Alert Enrichment**
   - Agents gather additional context about alerts from various sources
   - Agents correlate related information to provide comprehensive incident context
   - Enriched alerts provide more context for workflow decision-making

2. **Incident Classification and Prioritization**
   - Agents analyze alert patterns and classify incidents by type
   - Severity assessment based on business impact
   - Dynamic adjustment of incident priority based on evolving conditions

3. **Workflow Selection and Customization**
   - Agents recommend appropriate workflows for specific incidents
   - Suggest workflow parameter values based on incident context
   - Dynamically adapt workflows to specific situations

4. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Agents investigate underlying causes using structured reasoning
   - Correlate data across multiple systems and timeframes
   - Generate human-readable reports with supporting evidence

5. **Runbook Improvement**
   - Analyze workflow execution patterns to identify improvement opportunities
   - Suggest new workflow templates based on recurring incident patterns
   - Help administrators create or update workflows through natural language

## Integration Architecture

The integration architecture introduces several new components:

1. **Agent Provider System**
   - Extension of Keep's provider ecosystem
   - Manages lifecycle of LangGraph agents
   - Handles authentication and communication with LLM services

2. **Agent Memory Store**
   - Persistent storage for agent observations and reasoning
   - Enables continuity across multiple incidents
   - Facilitates learning from past experiences

3. **Tool Registry**
   - Exposes Keep's existing provider actions as tools for agents
   - Manages permissions and rate limiting for tool usage
   - Provides standardized interfaces for tool invocation

4. **Agent Workflow Engine**
   - Based on LangGraph for managing agent state and transitions
   - Handles parallel reasoning paths and backtracking
   - Maintains context throughout agent execution

5. **Human Feedback Mechanism**
   - Collects operator feedback on agent suggestions
   - Incorporates feedback into agent decision-making
   - Creates learning opportunities from human expertise

## Implementation Phases

The integration will proceed in phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement the Agent Provider framework
- Create basic LangGraph agents for alert enrichment
- Develop initial tool registry with read-only operations
- Establish monitoring and observability for agent operations

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities
- Expand tool registry to include write operations (with approval)
- Implement the agent memory store
- Add more sophisticated agent reasoning patterns
- Develop human feedback collection mechanisms

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration
- Implement autonomous agent operations within defined boundaries
- Develop learning mechanisms from past incidents
- Create agent-to-agent communication patterns
- Optimize performance and resource usage

## Technical Considerations

### Performance and Scalability
- Implement timeouts for agent operations
- Create fallback mechanisms when agents are unavailable
- Consider batching for high-volume operations
- Implement caching for common agent queries

### Security
- Define clear permission boundaries for agent operations
- Implement approval workflows for sensitive actions
- Ensure proper data handling and privacy compliance
- Conduct regular security reviews of agent capabilities

### Observability
- Log all agent operations with context and reasoning
- Monitor agent performance and success rates
- Create dashboards for agent activity and outcomes
- Implement alerting for agent failures or anomalies

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Reliability Risks**
   - Implement circuit breakers for agent operations
   - Maintain fallback to traditional workflows when agents fail
   - Ensure critical paths have deterministic alternatives

2. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor token usage and implement budgets
   - Optimize prompts for efficiency
   - Use caching and batching to reduce API calls

3. **Explainability**
   - Require agents to document their reasoning process
   - Create audit trails for all agent decisions
   - Provide mechanisms to explain agent recommendations

## Conclusion

The integration of LangGraph-based Agentic features into Keep represents a significant enhancement to the platform's capabilities. By taking a hybrid approach that combines Keep's reliable workflow engine with the flexibility and intelligence of Agentic AI, the platform can deliver more adaptive, context-aware, and autonomous operations while maintaining the reliability and predictability required for critical infrastructure management.

This architecture provides a balanced path forward, allowing organizations to incrementally adopt Agentic capabilities while leveraging their existing investment in Keep workflows and integrations.
