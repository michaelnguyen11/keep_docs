  - Development server with 8+ GPUs for model fine-tuning
  - 1TB+ storage for training data and models

- **Production Environment**:
  - Kubernetes cluster with GPU nodes for agent execution
  - High-performance storage for vector database
  - Elastic scaling capabilities for handling peak loads

### Software & Services

  - Access to base models (e.g., DeepSeek R1)
  - Fine-tuning frameworks and libraries
  - Model versioning and registry

- **Development Tools**:
  - LangGraph framework
  - Vector database (e.g., Qdrant, Pinecone)
  - CI/CD pipeline with ML model tracking

### Training & Knowledge

- Documentation of existing systems
- Access to domain experts for knowledge extraction
- Training on LangGraph and agent development
- Time allocation for learning and experimentation

## Risk Factors & Contingency Plans

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM fine-tuning challenges | Delays in specialized agent development | Start with general-purpose models, gradually specialize |
| Integration complexity with Keep | Extended Phase 1 timeline | Develop clear interfaces early, use mocks for testing |
| Performance issues with high data volume | System unable to handle full load | Incremental data volume testing, optimize early |
| Limited team expertise | Slower progress, quality issues | Allocate time for training, consider external consultation |
| Model accuracy problems | Reduced system effectiveness | Establish clear evaluation metrics, iterative improvement |

## Key Milestones & Success Criteria

1. **End of Phase 0**: Complete system architecture and data strategy
2. **End of Phase 1**: Keep platform integrated with monitoring systems with data flowing
3. **End of Phase 2**: Working orchestrator agent with one specialized agent
4. **End of Phase 3**: Complete agent ecosystem with all specialized agents
5. **End of Phase 4**: Full user interface with feedback system
6. **End of Phase 5**: Production system with demonstrable benefits

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline spans approximately 11 months (44 weeks) from initial planning to fully deployed system with a team of 3 specialists. The phased approach allows for:

1. Progressive development and integration
2. Regular evaluation and course correction
3. Incremental delivery of value throughout the project
4. Knowledge building within the team

The timeline accounts for the complexity of both integrating with Keep and developing specialized AI capabilities, while considering the constraints of a small team. Regular reviews at the end of each phase will allow for adjustments to the plan based on progress and evolving requirements.
