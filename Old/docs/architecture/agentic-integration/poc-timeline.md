## Scope Limitations (PoC vs. Production)

To ensure the PoC can be completed within 4 weeks, the following limitations apply:

1. **Limited Scale**: Process only a subset of logs (~10GB) rather than the full 600GB/day
2. **Pre-filtered Data**: Use pre-selected log samples representing various scenarios
3. **Existing Models**: Use off-the-shelf LLMs without custom fine-tuning
4. **Single Specialized Agent**: Implement only one specialized agent instead of the full ecosystem
5. **Simplified Memory**: Basic context tracking without persistent vector storage
6. **Limited Integration**: Connect to only one monitoring system (e.g., Dynatrace or Splunk)
7. **Manual Steps**: Some processes will require manual intervention in the PoC flow

## Success Criteria

The PoC will be considered successful if it demonstrates:

1. **Feasibility**: Keep can be integrated with Agentic AI components
2. **Filtering Efficiency**: ML filtering can reduce log volume by at least 90%
3. **Agent Coordination**: Orchestrator can direct work to a specialized agent
4. **Value-Add Analysis**: Agent provides useful insights beyond raw log data
5. **Performance**: The system can process the test dataset with acceptable latency

## Resources Required

- **Development Environment**:
  - 3 workstations with GPUs for development
  - Cloud-based GPU instances for LLM inference (e.g., AWS g4dn or similar)
  - Development instance of Keep platform

- **Software & Services**:
  - Access to OpenAI API or Anthropic API for LLM capabilities
  - LangGraph for agent orchestration
  - Basic monitoring system access (limited scope)

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Working code repository with all PoC components
- [ ] Technical documentation of the implementation
- [ ] Demo environment for stakeholder presentation
- [ ] Performance metrics and benchmarks
- [ ] Lessons learned and recommendations
- [ ] Proposed roadmap for production implementation

## Post-PoC Next Steps

If the PoC is successful, the following next steps are recommended:

1. Gather stakeholder feedback on the demonstrated capabilities
2. Refine architecture based on PoC learnings
3. Develop a detailed implementation plan for production
4. Secure resources for full-scale implementation
5. Prioritize components for the first production phase

## PoC Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration challenges with Keep | Delayed PoC completion | Prepare mock interfaces, limit scope of integration |
| LLM performance issues | Suboptimal agent capabilities | Optimize prompts, use higher-tier models as needed |
| Data processing bottlenecks | Slow demonstration | Pre-process test data, optimize critical paths |
| Limited hardware resources | Development constraints | Leverage cloud resources for intensive tasks |
| Knowledge gaps | Implementation delays | Focus on well-understood components, schedule quick learning sessions |
