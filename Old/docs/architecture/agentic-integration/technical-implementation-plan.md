# LangGraph Integration: Technical Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed technical implementation plan for integrating LangGraph-based Agentic features into the Keep AIOps platform.

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Install LangGraph and related dependencies
pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain_openai sqlmodel fastapi pydantic

# Optional: vector database for advanced memory capabilities
pip install pgvector chromadb
```

## Implementation Phases

The implementation will be organized into seven phases, each building on the previous ones:

### Phase 1: Agent Provider Framework (Weeks 1-3)

**Goals:**
- Create the core Agent Provider class that extends Keep's BaseProvider
- Implement configuration models for agent settings
- Set up LLM initialization with different provider options

**Key Components:**
- `AgentProvider` class
- `AgentProviderConfig` model
- LLM initialization with multi-provider support

### Phase 2: Tool Registry Implementation (Weeks 3-5)

**Goals:**
- Create a registry for storing and accessing agent tools
- Implement adapters for existing Keep providers
- Create tool formatters for different LLM providers

**Key Components:**
- `ToolRegistry` class
- `ToolDefinition` model
- Provider action adapters
- OpenAI function-calling format converter

### Phase 3: Agent Workflow Engine (Weeks 5-7)

**Goals:**
- Implement LangGraph-based agent workflows
- Create state management for agent execution
- Set up reasoning and decision logic

**Key Components:**
- LangGraph state graph definition
- Agent state management
- Tool execution node
- Reasoning and planning node

### Phase 4: Memory System Integration (Weeks 7-9)

**Goals:**
- Create persistent storage for agent observations and reasoning
- Implement memory retrieval mechanisms
- Set up relevance-based memory search

**Key Components:**
- `AgentMemoryEntry` model
- `AgentMemoryStore` service
- Memory retrieval methods with filtering
- Similar memory search capabilities

### Phase 5: Human Feedback System (Weeks 9-11)

**Goals:**
- Implement feedback collection for agent actions
- Create storage for different types of feedback
- Set up feedback processing mechanisms

**Key Components:**
- `AgentFeedback` model
- `HumanFeedbackService`
- Feedback processing system
- Modified action storage

### Phase 6: API Endpoints (Weeks 11-12)

**Goals:**
- Create API endpoints for agent operations
- Implement feedback submission endpoints
- Set up background processing for feedback

**Key Components:**
- Agent execution endpoints
- Feedback submission API
- Background tasks for processing
- Request and response models

### Phase 7: Workflow Integration (Weeks 12-14)

**Goals:**
- Create workflow steps that use the Agent Provider
- Implement example workflows with agent integration
- Set up context passing between steps and agents

**Key Components:**
- Agent-enhanced workflow steps
- Example workflow definitions
- Context management between agents and workflows

## Testing Strategy

The implementation will be tested at various levels:

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Component-level testing for all major classes
   - Mocked dependencies for isolation
   - Input/output validation

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Tests for interactions between components
   - Database and memory store integration
   - Tool registry and provider integration

3. **End-to-End Tests:**
   - Complete workflow execution with agents
   - API endpoint testing
   - Realistic scenario testing

4. **Performance Testing:**
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Token usage tracking
