   - Add proper indexes to `alert`, `alert_raw`, and `last_alert` tables
   - Implement table partitioning by time for the alert table
   - Add compression for text fields

2. Implement selective raw alert storage:
   - Create a filter mechanism for `KEEP_STORE_RAW_ALERTS`
   - Implement sampling for high-volume alert sources

3. Enhance the `LastAlert` optimization:
   - Implement a periodic cleanup job for the `last_alert` table
   - Add TTL for inactive fingerprints
   - Create a migration script for existing alerts

## Task 6: Batch Processing Pipeline
**Assigned to**: [Developer 6]  
**Estimated time**: 4-5 days

1. Implement batch alert processing:
   - Create a batch processor for high-volume ingestion
   - Add configuration for batch size and timeout
   - Implement parallel processing for batches

2. Add error handling for batches:
   - Create a dead-letter queue for failed alerts
   - Implement retry policies for batch failures
   - Add monitoring for batch processing errors

3. Optimize transaction management:
   - Implement efficient bulk inserts
   - Configure appropriate transaction isolation levels
   - Add advisory locks for concurrent batch processing

## Task 7: Performance Testing Infrastructure
**Assigned to**: [Developer 7]  
**Estimated time**: 3-4 days

1. Create load testing scripts:
   - Implement JMeter/Locust test scripts simulating 600GB/day volume
   - Create realistic alert generator based on production patterns
   - Implement variable load testing scenarios (steady, spikes, etc.)

2. Set up monitoring for performance tests:
   - Configure detailed metrics collection during tests
   - Implement dashboards for visualizing bottlenecks
   - Add automated test result analysis

3. Create a performance regression test suite:
   - Implement CI/CD integration for performance testing
   - Set up baseline performance metrics
   - Add alerts for performance degradation

## Task 8: Provider Throttling & Backpressure
**Assigned to**: [Developer 8]  
**Estimated time**: 2-3 days

1. Implement provider rate limiting:
   - Add configurable rate limits per provider
   - Implement token bucket algorithm for throttling
   - Add response headers for rate limit status

2. Create backpressure mechanisms:
   - Implement HTTP 429 responses during overload
   - Add retry-after headers with appropriate values
   - Create exponential backoff recommendations for clients

3. Monitor provider throughput:
   - Track ingestion rates per provider
   - Alert on providers exceeding thresholds
   - Create dashboards for provider traffic patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Set up a high-volume simulation environment with Docker Compose
   - Configure resource limits mimicking production
   - Implement monitoring for all components

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Maintain test coverage above 85%
   - Add performance tests for critical paths
   - Document all configuration parameters

3. **Rollout Strategy**:
   - Implement feature flags for progressive enablement
   - Create database migration scripts for schema changes
   - Design a gradual deployment strategy with monitoring

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update architecture diagrams with implementations
   - Document performance characteristics and scaling limits
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Dependencies Between Tasks

- Tasks 1 and 2 should be worked on first as they form the foundation
- Task 3 depends on Task 5 for schema definitions
- Task 6 depends on Tasks 1, 2, and 4
- Task 7 should be implemented early to validate other tasks
- Task 8 can be implemented independently
