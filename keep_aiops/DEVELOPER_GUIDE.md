# Developer Guide: Implementing High-Volume Alert Processing

This guide will help you understand how to use the detailed task guidelines for implementing high-volume alert processing capabilities in Keep.

## Overview

Keep needs to be adapted to process ~600GB/day of logs, events, and alerts. You've been assigned specific tasks to enhance the alert ingestion and processing module. This guide will help you approach your assigned task effectively.

## Getting Started

1. **Understand your assigned task**:
   - Locate your task in the [Alert Module Tasks](ALERT_MODULE_TASKS.md) document
   - Review the task description, estimated time, and dependencies
   - Make note of any tasks your task depends on

2. **Study the relevant diagrams**:
   - Review the [Alert Processing Sequence Diagram](diagrams/sequence/alert_processing_sequence.puml)
   - Examine the [Alert Class Diagram](diagrams/class/alert_incident_class_diagram.puml)
   - Look at the [C4 Component Diagram](diagrams/c4/c4_keep_component_improved.puml)

3. **Locate your task guideline**:
   - Find the detailed implementation guide for your task in the `task_guidelines` directory
   - Read through the entire guide before starting implementation

## Using the Task Guidelines

Each task guideline is structured to help you implement the assigned task with minimal supervision:

1. **Overview** - Explains the purpose of the task and its importance for high-volume processing
2. **Implementation Steps** - Provides detailed, step-by-step instructions with actual code examples
3. **Testing** - Includes test scripts to verify your implementation works correctly
4. **Common Pitfalls** - Lists issues you should watch out for during implementation
5. **Additional Resources** - Links to external documentation that might be helpful

## Development Workflow

Follow this workflow to successfully implement your task:

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-task-name
   ```

2. **Implement the changes**:
   - Follow the steps in your task guideline
   - Add comments to explain complex parts of your code
   - Break the implementation into small, testable changes

3. **Test as you go**:
   - Run the provided test scripts after implementing each component
   - Fix any issues before moving on to the next component
   - Add your own tests for edge cases

4. **Seek help when needed**:
   - If you get stuck, ask questions in the team chat
   - Be specific about what you've tried and where you're stuck
   - Reference the specific section of the guideline you're having trouble with

5. **Submit for review**:
   - Make sure all tests pass
   - Create a pull request with a clear description of your changes
   - Reference the task number in your PR description

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Understanding the existing codebase
- **Solution**: Start by running the test scripts to see how current functionality works
- Use logging to trace execution flow through the current code

### Challenge 2: Redis connection issues
- **Solution**: Make sure Redis is running in your development environment
- Check your connection parameters (host, port, password, etc.)
- Use the Redis CLI to verify you can connect manually

### Challenge 3: Worker pool behavior
- **Solution**: Add detailed logging to debug worker pool issues
- Start with fewer workers during testing (2-3) to make issues more visible
- Use Python's `threading.enumerate()` to check thread states

### Challenge 4: Elasticsearch configuration
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using a compatible Elasticsearch version (7.x or 8.x)
- Check that your mappings are correct for the data you're indexing
- Use Elasticsearch's development tools to test queries directly

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in the guidelines:

1. **Check the official documentation**:
   - [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/docs/)
   - [Elasticsearch Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html)
   - [Python ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor)

2. **Ask for help in these channels**:
   - Team Slack channel: #keep-dev
   - Weekly team meeting (Thursdays at 10am)
   - Daily standup

3. **Debugging techniques**:
   - Add detailed logging at key points in your code
   - Use Python's `pdb` debugger for step-by-step debugging
   - Create minimal reproduction cases for complex issues

## Performance Testing

After implementing your task, you'll need to verify it can handle high volumes:

1. **Small-scale testing**: Start with a few hundred alerts to verify functionality
2. **Medium-scale testing**: Test with a few thousand alerts to check for bottlenecks
3. **Full-scale testing**: Use the provided load testing scripts to simulate 600GB/day volume

Document any performance bottlenecks you encounter and how you resolved them.

## Final Checklist Before Submission

- [ ] All implementation steps from the guide are completed
- [ ] Test scripts run successfully
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Documentation is updated with any changes to APIs or configuration
- [ ] Performance testing shows the implementation can handle the required volume
- [ ] No known bugs or edge cases are left unhandled

Good luck with your implementation! With these detailed guidelines, you should be able to successfully enhance Keep's capabilities for high-volume alert processing.
