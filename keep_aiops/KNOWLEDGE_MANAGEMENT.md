# Keep AIOps Knowledge Management

## Overview

The Knowledge Management module in Keep AIOps leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning to build a dynamic knowledge base that captures operational intelligence, incident patterns, and resolution workflows. This module serves as an institutional memory for IT operations, enabling faster incident resolution, knowledge sharing, and continuous learning from past incidents.

## LLM Integration Architecture

### External AI Framework

Keep AIOps implements an extensible External AI framework that allows integration with various LLM and ML services:

1. **ExternalAI Model**
   - Core abstraction for AI integrations
   - Support for API-based LLM integrations
   - Configurable settings per algorithm
   - Client-side reminder mechanism for stateless AI services

2. **Transformer-Based Correlation**
   - Primary implementation of the External AI framework
   - Uses transformer models to correlate alerts into incidents
   - Configurable accuracy thresholds and training parameters
   - Tenant-specific model training for customized correlation

3. **API-Based LLM Integration**
   - Support for both cloud-based and local LLM deployments
   - Secure API key management for LLM services
   - Configurable endpoints for different LLM providers
   - Air-gap compatibility for secure environments

### Knowledge Base Structure

The knowledge base is structured as a combination of:

1. **Alert-Incident Correlations**
   - Historical mappings of alerts to incidents
   - Pattern recognition through transformer models
   - Fingerprinting algorithms for similarity detection
   - Temporal and contextual relationship tracking

2. **Resolution Workflows**
   - Captured remediation steps from past incidents
   - Executable workflow templates based on past resolutions
   - Auto-suggested remediation actions
   - Knowledge extraction from workflow executions

3. **Enrichment Context**
   - Topology information related to affected systems
   - Performance metrics and baselines
   - Historical alert patterns
   - External documentation references

## Knowledge Capture Mechanisms
