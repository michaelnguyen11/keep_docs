# Keep AIOps User Interface

## Overview

The Keep AIOps User Interface is built as a modern, responsive web application designed to handle the display and interaction with large volumes of alert and incident data (up to 600GB/day). The UI is implemented using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, with a component architecture that emphasizes reusability, performance, and scalability.

## Architecture

### Feature-Slice Design

The UI follows a modified **Feature-Slice Design** architectural pattern, which organizes code into layers:

1. **App Layer** (`/app`): Next.js route-based folder structure
   - Contains page components and layouts
   - Handles routing and server-side rendering

2. **Widgets Layer** (`/widgets`): Complex UI components that implement specific business features
   - `alerts-table`: Advanced table for alert visualization
   - `workflow-builder`: UI for creating and editing automation workflows

3. **Features Layer** (`/features`): User scenarios and business logic
   - `alerts`: Alert-related features (history, status changes, enrichment)
   - `incidents`: Incident management features
   - `workflows`: Workflow automation features
   - `presets`: Saved views and filters

4. **Entities Layer** (`/entities`): Business entities and their models
   - `alerts`: Alert data models and state management
   - `incidents`: Incident data models and state management
   - `users`: User management and authentication
   - `workflows`: Workflow definitions and execution models

5. **Shared Layer** (`/shared`): Reusable components and utilities
   - `ui`: Base UI components
   - `lib`: Utility functions
   - `api`: API client and data fetching logic

### Component Structure

Each slice (e.g., "alerts" in the entities layer) is further divided into:

- `ui`: UI components specific to the slice
- `api`: Backend interaction logic
- `model`: Data models, schemas, and business logic
- `lib`: Helper functions and utilities

## Core UI Components

### Alert Visualization

1. **Alert Table** (`/widgets/alerts-table/ui/alert-table-server-side.tsx`)
   - Server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting
   - Dynamic column generation based on alert data
   - Virtualized rendering for handling thousands of alerts
   - Advanced filtering capabilities with CEL (Common Expression Language)

2. **Faceted Filtering** (`/features/filter/facet-panel-server-side.tsx`)
   - Dynamic filters based on alert properties
   - Multi-select options with counts
   - Custom rendering for different data types (severity, assignee, etc.)

### Incident Management

1. **Incident List** (`/features/incidents/incident-list/ui/incident-list.tsx`)
   - Tabular view of incidents with status indicators
   - Severity visualization with color-coding
   - Timeline views and correlation insights

2. **Incident Details** (`/app/(keep)/incidents/[id]/`)
   - Multi-tab interface (Overview, Alerts, Timeline, Activity)
   - Related alerts and affected services visualization
   - Action buttons for incident management workflow

### Workflow Automation

1. **Workflow Builder** (`/widgets/workflow-builder`)
   - Visual workflow editor for creating automation rules
   - Step configuration panels
   - YAML editor with syntax highlighting
   - Execution logs and debugging information

2. **Workflow Execution** (`/entities/workflow-executions`)
   - Execution history and status tracking
   - Result visualization
   - Error handling and debugging tools

## User Experience Design

### Layout and Navigation

1. **Global Layout** (`/app/(keep)/layout.tsx`)
   - Responsive sidebar navigation
   - Persistent header with user information
   - Breadcrumb navigation for context

2. **Dashboard** (`/app/(keep)/dashboard`)
   - Widget-based overview of system status
   - Key metrics and trends visualization
   - Quick access to recent incidents and alerts

### Interaction Patterns

1. **Alert Actions**
   - Context menus for common actions
   - Bulk operations for multiple alerts
   - One-click enrichment and status changes

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Live polling with configurable intervals
   - WebSocket integration for instant notifications
   - Visual indicators for new/updated data

3. **Modal Dialogs**
   - Non-disruptive forms for quick actions
   - Multi-step wizards for complex operations
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Styling and Theming

1. **Tailwind CSS**
   - Utility-first CSS framework for consistent styling
   - Custom theme with dark mode support
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **Tremor Components**
   - Integration with Tremor for data visualization
   - Charts, cards, and other data-focused components
   - Consistent design language

## Performance Optimizations

### Large Dataset Handling

1. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Initial page load with pre-rendered content
   - Reduced client-side computation for faster load times
   - SEO benefits and better accessibility

2. **Virtualization**
   - Only renders visible elements in long lists
   - Reduces DOM size and memory usage
   - Smooth scrolling even with thousands of items

3. **Data Pagination**
   - Server-side pagination for large datasets
   - Configurable page sizes
   - Efficient navigation controls

4. **Incremental Static Regeneration**
   - Caching static parts of the UI
   - Periodic background updates
   - Reduced server load for common views

### Optimized Rendering

1. **Memoization**
   - React's `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive computations
   - Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Selective updates when data changes

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Reduced initial bundle size

3. **State Management**
   - SWR for data fetching and caching
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Request deduplication and batching

## User Customization

1. **View Customization**
   - Configurable table columns (visibility, order, size)
   - Saved filters and views as "presets"
   - Personal dashboards

2. **Time Formats**
   - Configurable datetime display formats
   - Relative or absolute time display
   - Timezone selection

3. **List Formats**
   - Different visualization options for list data
   - Compact vs. detailed views
   - Grouping and nesting options

## Accessibility

1. **ARIA Compliance**
   - Proper labeling for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management for modals and dialogs

2. **Color Contrast**
   - High contrast options for severity levels
   - Visibility considerations for color-blind users
   - Text-based alternatives for color indicators

## Implementation Recommendations

For implementing the User Interface module with high-volume data (600GB/day):

1. **Start with Core Views**
   - Implement alert table with server-side pagination first
   - Focus on efficient data loading patterns
   - Optimize for common user workflows

2. **Add Real-time Capabilities**
   - Implement polling for active views
   - Add WebSocket support for instant notifications
   - Balance freshness with performance

3. **Enhance with Customization**
   - Allow users to customize views based on their needs
   - Implement presets for common filtering patterns
   - Support for personal preferences (time formats, etc.)

4. **Optimize for Scale**
   - Load testing with simulated high-volume data
   - Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
   - Implement additional virtualization or pagination as needed

5. **Enhance Mobile Experience**
   - Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Consider a dedicated mobile view for key actions
